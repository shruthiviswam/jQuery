# JQuery

JQuery is the easiest and most popular javascript library. A library is just a collection of tools that allows us to implement functionality or effets without the need to write all the code that is needed to perform a certain task.

The purpose of JQuery is to make it easier to use JavaScript on the website. JQuery is light-weight javascript library which means "write less, do more".

The JQuery library contains the features :
- HTML/DOM manipulation
- CSS manipulation
- HTML event methods
- Effects and animations
- AJAX
- Utilities

## Adding JQuery :

There are two methods to add JQuery :
1) Download the JQuery library from Query.com
2) Include JQuery from a CDN, like Google.

## Downloading JQuery :

Two versions are available for downloading :
1) Production version : This is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed.
2) Devolopment version : This is for testing and devolopment. (uncompressed and readable code)

## JQuery Syntax :

It is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some actions on the elements : 
Basic Syntax is : $(selector).action()
    * $ sign is to define/access JQuery
    * (selector) to "query" or find HTML elements
    * action() to be performed on elements
